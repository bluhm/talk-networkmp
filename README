Slides for my talk about faster networking on OpenBSD.

For a long time OpenBSD network stack was not running on multiple
processors in parallel.  Partially it has been made MP ready in the
previous releases.  This talk gives an overview of what has been
achieved, explains pitfalls, and shows the tooling used.  In kernel
development, and especially in multi processor environments, a good
test equipment is necessary.  The test results provided on
http://bluhm.genua.de/perform/results/perform.html give insight
about progress during the development process.  Interesting changes
and their effects will be explained.
